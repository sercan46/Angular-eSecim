# ESecim

My project where I developed the front end with Angular. My goal in my project is to enable the public to vote for elections online at home. I used .Net in the backend part of my project. In my project, users register to the system and then log in with their ID numbers. Each user can stay in the system for 1 minute and vote once.

## To start the project

npm install

ng serve --open
